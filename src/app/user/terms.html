	                        Rules then in effect. However, the rules will be modified in the following ways: (1) each arbitrator
	                        will agree to treat as confidential evidence and other information presented to the same extent as
	                        the information is required to be kept confidential under these Terms, (2) the arbitrators may not
	                        amend or modify the terms of these Terms, (3) a decision must be rendered within 10 business days
	                        of the parties’ closing statements or submission of post-hearing briefs and (4) the arbitration will
	                        be conducted before a panel of three arbitrators, one selected by CloudLex within 10 days of the
	                        commencement of arbitration, one selected by You in the same period, and the third selected jointly
	                        by these arbitrators (or, if they are unable to agree on an arbitrator within 30 days of the commencement
	                        of arbitration, the third arbitrator will be appointed by the American Arbitration Association).

	                        should bring a proceeding against the other party (the <b><i>"Defendant"</i></b>) in connection with
	                        an alleged breach or threatened breach of these Terms, the prevailing party shall be entitled to

	                        with prejudice by the Plaintiff, the Defendant shall be deemed to be the prevailing party. </p>

	                        provision or of the right to enforce it at a later time.</p>
